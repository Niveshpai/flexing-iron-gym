  <h1 align="center">Gym Management System</h1>
  <p align="center">
    Gym Management System is designed for the purpose of adding records in a gym. In this project, the user as well as owner can store records depending on various categories. The user can add, edit, view, delete records of the members of the gym.

## Inspiration
Data Structures and Algorithm course introduces us the data structures used to solve, day to day problems and in the lab, we automate and apply the theory concepts to solve those problems. We study this course/lab to know how data structures work and which data structure to use for what problem by analysing its efficiency, our day to day lives are highly influenced by data structures and data structures are the backbone of modern-day technology. </br>
Data structures can be seen in nature and hence from nature we derived the data structure, even though today we have efficient data structure to solve many problems we still seek to have more efficient ones hence as a beginner it becomes the responsibility of everyone who studies data structure to find more efficient data structure and implement them. In this project we try to implement various data structure concepts to our given topics to understand their role and importance better. 

## What it does
It is used to simulate the functionalities that take place at a gym and fitness centre. We take note of every functioning that happens at a gym and implement them using data structures and algorithm concepts in the C code. The course project is to automate the operations by storing records in the form of user-friendly database further facilitating easy access to personnel.


## How I built it
The program is written using "C" language. The compiler used is GNU/GCC and the IDE used is CodeBlocks. </br>
The Algorithms used were :  Brute force String search, Binary Search, Insertion Sort, Dijikstra algorithm, files and structures.


## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud that I was able to learn multiple data structures and . Initially, we took several days to understand what functions we had to implement. Later on, we were  able to complete the project within the mentioned deadline. </br>

 
## What I learned
My biggest learning is that to break down the larger code into smaller functions. This helps in creating an optimised, elegant, efficient, readable, simple, without duplications, and well-written code. Our time in this project has helped us create quality and meaningful code. It has also real helped us develop a useful ability where-in we can convert learnt theoretical concepts into real-life applications.  </br>

Also, another aspect to keep in mind is the interface of the program/application. In addition to creating efficient code, we need to also emphasize on the user interface. We learnt on how to implement various sorting and searching techniques in the code. The project helped us learn how to communicate effectively with our team members, enhance critical-thinking, coping with pressure and completed assigned tasks within the fixed deadline.
